# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

**This package has been renamed and moved to a new repository.**

## New Package

**Use [@iloveagents/foundry-voice-live-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iloveagents/foundry-voice-live-react) instead.**

```bash
npm install @iloveagents/foundry-voice-live-react
```

**New Repository:** [github.com/iloveagents/foundry-voice-live](https://github.com/iloveagents/foundry-voice-live)

---

## Migration

Update your imports:

```diff
- import { useVoiceLive, VoiceLiveAvatar } from '@iloveagents/azure-voice-live-react';
+ import { useVoiceLive, VoiceLiveAvatar } from '@iloveagents/foundry-voice-live-react';
```

The API is fully compatible - just change the package name.

---

## Why the rename?

The package was renamed to better align with Microsoft's **Foundry Voice Live API** branding and to include additional tools like a secure proxy server.
